1. History
==========
Subversion ALM is an add-on for JIRA to integrate Subversion repositories from anywhere.

Originally it was named "Subversion PLUS" as it was a pure improvement of Subversion mainly by:

* replacing the Lucene index by a H2 relational database
* bundling a customized version of the Polarion's Web Client for Subversion

Later, a lot of features improving traceability with JIRA were added and the name
changed to "Subversion ALM". The major new features were:

* commit graphs
* commit calendars
* JQL functions
